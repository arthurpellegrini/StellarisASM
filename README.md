Stellaris_ASM
==============================================================

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------

This project was developed as part of the architecture module in our Computer Science and Application engineering program at ESIEE-IT. Stellaris_ASM is an assembly (.s) program that enables control of a robot through two selectable movement modes using switches:

* Classic
* Labyrinth Solver

The following tools were used for the development of this program:

* Stellaris Cortex M3 Robot
* ARM Cortex M3 Assembly
* Keil uVision4

Classic Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Pressing both bumpers: Turn on both LEDs and perform a U-turn.
* Pressing the right bumper: Turn on the left LED and turn left.
* Pressing the left bumper: Turn on the right LED and turn right.

Labyrinth Solver Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------

Labyrinth escape method based on the Pledge algorithm:

* If the counter is 0, move straight ahead until reaching the wall in front.
* From this wall, turn in the preferred direction (always the same, let's say left).
* Then, follow the wall by adding 1 to the counter when turning right and subtracting 1 when turning left.
* If the counter is 0, detach from the wall and move straight ahead.
